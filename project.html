    <h1>Project + Ideas</h1>
        <p>✧ In this project, we are going to download and look at our social media data set in order to summarise how individuals are living in this huge internet and social system.</p>
        
        <p><font color="#000000">✧</font></p>
        
        <p>✧ First, I decided to investigate about myself by reviewing my Wechat data, then, I choose some of my posts this year and downloaded the data with comments and likes from my friends and family members, while I also collected some chats with people about these posts to see if there are some interesting discovery.</p>
        <p>✧ The posts I choose included myself portrait, presenting my daily life in different areas, these 8 photos included my hobby, places I visited, my craft-works, drawings and my favourites. I found out that people really like how I share my life with them, and showing some beautiful pictures of things that I really enjoy, they think it is relaxing and interesting; some also commented how they feel, and there are also people asking about some details. I think these experiments and records only form a half of my life, but chats and communication in the social platforms forms another half of it, and even makes it better.</p>
        <p>✧ I gain the most “likes” from my food posts and place(landscape) posts, they commented that my photography skills are pretty well, but I am not so interactive with comments and likes, but still, I want to record these glorious moments by this project.</p>

        <p>✧ By researching the data collections, I want to create my self portrait with my photos(photography) and comments(and chats) from others, I think this will be a good intension to present both my project and me. I will be overlapping all of the images and words, as if these things form my daily life.</p>

        <p><strong><font size=5px>✧ Tools I used ✧</font></strong></p>
        
        <p>✧ Photoshop: To overlap the words(comments) on images(my posts).</p>
        <p>✧ HTML: The media used to present this project and my ideas.</p>
        <p>✧ Data: Data downloaded from Wechat(Social media platform that I use).</p>
        <p>✧ Photo/Images: The photograph/images that I posted.</p>

        <p><strong><font size=5px>✧ Conclusion ✧</font></strong></p>
        
        <p>✧ I think this project is very interesting, I investigated myself as a system, by looking at the data base on social media, recognising people around us forms a community, and me myself makes it works day to day and creates unity.</p>
        <p>✧ By looking at the posts, chats and comments from other people, I also understand myself better. I often chat with my mother but not my father, we talk about my posts and my feelings, most of the time my mom only “likes” what I posted and chat something that makes my happy. I am not too social with friends and classmates, we chat a few, mostly talk about things that are important or recommend each other for some things/places.</p>
        <p>✧ Although I do not often chat with people and friends on Wechat, still, they are keep following my daily and paying a lot of attentions, and I did not notice that before.</p>
